Final Project Notes with Matt
Dataset Ideas
1. AI Adoption Across Industries 
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tfisthis/global-ai-tool-adoption-across-industries
    Outstanding Questions
        What would we actually do with this?
        What type of app could we create?
2. Movie rating/suggestion app? Think Beli but for Movies
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivvm/popular-movies-imdb-reviews-dataset
    We could start with this and then add fake data.
    We could also create things that would allow people to enter more data
    Outstanding Questions
        Is there a larger rating dataset we could get access to?
3. Same as above but for Books.
4.
