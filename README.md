## Project Overview

The app leverages Neo4j as the backend database and a Flask API to serve movie and user data to a lightweight web interface.  

### Core Features
1. User profiles – Create users with watchlists, ratings, and reviews.  
2. Social graph – Connect friends and explore "friends of friends" relationships.  
3. Movie discovery – Search by genres, actors, directors.  
4. Recommendations – Personalized suggestions using ratings and social connections.  
5. Interactive query GUI – A built-in web console for testing endpoints against the Neo4j graph.
